# REACT REDUX

This repository is a boilerplate for react. It is intended to be simple and straight forward to be used as simple project baseline as well as prototyping use.
Basic Webpack is being added into this boilerplate as well as some automation with gulp and local webserver to serve the page.

The package manage was using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). experimenting with that while making this boilerplate.
